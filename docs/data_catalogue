## 📊 Power BI Use Cases

- 🚴‍♂️ **Trip Volume Analysis** by date, hour, and user type  
- 🧭 **Popular Routes** (Start → End station paths)  
- 📈 **Average Trip Duration** trends  
- 🗺️ **Heatmaps** of active stations  
- 👥 **Member vs Non-Member Behavior**

## 🔄 Suggested Enhancements

- Add `trip_start_date` if available to enable full trip timeline analysis.  
- Link station keys to a `dim_stations` table for metadata (e.g., borough, capacity).  
- Connect to a `dim_date` table for calendar-based filters (day, week, month, season).  
- Derive KPIs like:
  - ⏱️ Average duration
  - 🕓 Peak usage hours
  - 🔄 Round-trip vs one-way patterns
